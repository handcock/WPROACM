WPROACM
==========

This is an R-shiny interface for the statnet suite of R packages. It currently incorporates functionality from the ergm, network and sna packages, allowing users to explore, fit and assess exponential random graph models via a simple GUI.

The app can be run in two ways:  

* Through the shinyapps server with this link:   https://handcock.shinyapps.io/WPROACM  

* On your local machine using the WPROACM R package:
```r
install.packages("WPROACM")
WPROACM::run_WPROACM()
```
